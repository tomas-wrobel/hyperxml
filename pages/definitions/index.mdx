# Introduction to Definitions

HyperXML provides powerful mechanisms for creating reusable components and injecting dynamic content through 
its `<definition>{:html}`, `<include>{:html}`, and `<parameter>{:html}` tags. These features allow developers 
to write more modular and maintainable code by defining reusable elements and including them with customizable parameters.

## Compile-Time Note

Definitions and includes in HyperXML are resolved during the compilation process. This 
means the components and their content are processed before the final HTML is produced, 
making them invisible to JavaScript and CSS at runtime. If you need dynamic content that 
changes at runtime, use the HTML standard `<template>{:html}` and `<slot>{:html}` elements.

```xml filename="runtime.xml" copy
<template id="my-template">
    <div class="content">
        <slot name="slotName">Default Content</slot>
    </div>
</template>
```
This HTML example shows how to define a template with a slot that can be filled with 
custom content at runtime. The `template` tag holds the structure, and the `slot` tag 
provides a placeholder for dynamic content, with "Default Content" as the fallback.
